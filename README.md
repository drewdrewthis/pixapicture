# PixaPicture

To run PixaPicture locally, you will need a Pixabay API key, which you can get [here](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images) once you make an account.

Once you have your API key, set it to an environment variable called `PIXABAY_KEY` when you run the app:

*Examples:*

- `PIXABAY_KEY=123examplekeyABC yarn start`
- `PIXABAY_KEY=123examplekeyABC yarn run ios`
- `PIXABAY_KEY=123examplekeyABC yarn run android`
